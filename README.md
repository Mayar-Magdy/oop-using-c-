### Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In this repository, I have delved deep into various OOP concepts using C++, enhancing my understanding by applying them in practice.

---

### Struct vs Class

In C++, both `struct` and `class` are used to define custom data types, but they have some differences in default access levels. While `struct` members are public by default, `class` members are private by default. 

---

### Function Overloading

Function overloading allows multiple functions in the same scope with the same name but with different parameters. This provides flexibility and enhances code readability.

---

### Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the operations of C++ operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc., for user-defined data types.

---

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the parent (base) and child (derived) classes.

---

### Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and serve as base classes for other classes. They contain one or more abstract methods, which must be implemented by derived classes.

---

### Composition

Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. It represents a "has-a" relationship between the containing class and the contained classes.

---

### Aggregation

Aggregation is a specialized form of association where objects have a "whole-part" relationship, but the parts can exist independently of the whole.

---

### Association

Association represents a relationship between two or more classes, indicating that they are connected but not necessarily dependent on each other.

---

### Graphics.h

Graphics.h is a header file used for graphics applications in C++. It provides functions to create graphical applications like drawing shapes, text, and images on the screen.

---

### Comparison between Struct and Class

This section explores the differences and similarities between `struct` and `class`, highlighting when to use each based on specific requirements.

---

### Abstract Pointers

Abstract pointers refer to pointers that point to base classes and can be used to refer to objects of derived classes. They facilitate polymorphism and dynamic binding.

---

### Template Functions

Template functions allow you to write generic functions that can work with different data types without repeating the code.

---

### Class Templates

Class templates allow you to define generic classes that can work with different data types. This promotes code reusability and flexibility.

---

### File Operations

#### ReadFile

This section covers reading data from files in C++, utilizing various techniques and best practices.

#### WriteFile

This section focuses on writing data to files in C++, exploring different methods and considerations for efficient file handling.

---

### Projects

Throughout this learning journey, I have applied the aforementioned concepts in various projects, reinforcing my understanding and practical skills in OOP with C++.
